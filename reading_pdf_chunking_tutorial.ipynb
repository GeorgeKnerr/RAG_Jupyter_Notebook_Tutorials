    "## Observation and Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### What did we achieve?\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Successfully loaded a PDF** using LangChain's PyMuPDFLoader, which is powered by the PyMuPDF engine under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **The loader extracted the text page by page**, and wrapped each into a `Document` object with metadata (like page number and file name).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points to Remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Page-based Chunking**: PyMuPDFLoader automatically chunks by pages, creating one Document object per page\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Metadata Preservation**: Each chunk includes valuable metadata:\n",
    "   - `page`: The page number (0-indexed)\n",
    "   - `source`: The original file path\n",
    "   - Other PDF-specific information\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Document Structure**: Each Document has:\n",
    "   - `page_content`: The actual text content\n",
    "   - `metadata`: Dictionary with additional information\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Next Steps**: For RAG applications, you might want to:\n",
    "   - Split large pages into smaller chunks\n",
    "   - Create embeddings for semantic search\n",
    "   - Store in a vector database\n",
    "   - Implement retrieval mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases:\n",
    "- Building RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems\n",
    "- Document question-answering applications\n",
    "- Semantic search over PDF documents\n",
    "- Information extraction from PDF libraries"
